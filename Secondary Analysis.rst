Secondary Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once a cluster file (_cluster.mat) has been made for a specific recording, this next analysis is run in order to set the spike detection thresholds for individual seizures and output information regarding all spikes within each cluster. This can be done using **AnalysisB**.

  1. Click **AnalysisB** >> Name the folder with any name to indicate this is the analysis output for this file

  ..

  2. The program will enter a new mode which brings up the first marked cluster. 

    * If the individual spike identification is satisfactory, click *Yes* to move to the next seizure
    * *No* will accept your current thresholds and apply them to the rest of the clusters
    * Click *modify* to readjust the detection threshold by dragging the black and red lines to the desired locations (black is negative threshold, red is positive)

  3. After the final cluster is adjusted, a plot will pop up showing all clusters overlaid onto the recording. This window can now be closed and the next recording can be opened for analysis.
