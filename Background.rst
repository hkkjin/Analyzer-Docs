Seizure analysis as done by our group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Temporal lobe epilepsy is one of the most common adult epilepsies and is known to be refractory to currently available anti-epileptic drugs. While most treatments, chemical or surgical, focus on lowering the number and severity of seizures, one area of research is instead focusing on interfering with the process of epileptogenesis. There have been many advances in this area of study but in general the network changes within the brain that lead to recurrent seizures is still unknown. (need refs) 

Previous work in our group utilized a real-time seizure detection program to allow for quick seizure detection and a response in order to intervene during these seizure using optogenetic stimulation to the temporal lobe in a rodent model of epilepsy. However, while the detection and intervention were automated, manual post-hoc analysis was necessary to confirm the identity of the cluster (whether it was a "seizure" or artefact) and to mark the actual cluster start and end. This process, while effective, was also very labor intensive and results were varied based on differences between scorers.

Unlike real time detection and intervention, quick response time was not needed for post-hoc cluster validation and refinement. To this end, a new analysis software was started in 2016 by TG to allow for more complex filtering and to also separate the analysis pipeline into two main steps: 1) in depth analysis of a single recording file, and 2) collection of results from multiple recording files for statistical analysis.
